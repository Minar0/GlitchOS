This page will change drastically soonish.

Oh, and I'm in the process of changing the name of the project from ZapsOS to GlitchOS. For the time being expect references to both names.

TODO List (in no particular order):<br />
Learn how to write documentation<br />
Write Documentation<br />
Write Weather module<br />
Write Time module<br />
Write Math module<br />
Write Maps module<br />
Allow Music module to pause or unpause music. This will replace the toggle pause function<br />
Fix Spotify Provider's pause state issue.<br />
  Actually I think replacing toggle pause altogether as mentioned in the above item will fix this issue<br />
Allow for searching via singer and artist in Spotify Provider<br />
Pass Music's ResponseEngine functions to the Provider for better control over what ZapsOS says.<br />
