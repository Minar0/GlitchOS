# ZapsOS
An open source virtual assistant running on Android and Apple devices
This page will change drastically soonish.

Oh, and I'm in the process of changing the name of the project from ZapsOS to GlitchOS. For the time being expect references to both names.

TODO List (in no particular order):
Learn how to write documentation
Write Documentation
Write Weather module
Write Time module
Write Math module
Write Maps module
Allow Music module to pause or unpause music. This will replace the toggle pause function
Fix Spotify Provider's pause state issue.
  Actually I think replacing toggle pause altogether as mentioned in the above item will fix this issue
Allow for searching via singer and artist in Spotify Provider
Pass Music's ResponseEngine functions to the Provider for better control over what ZapsOS says.
