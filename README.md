GlitchOS
========

Modern day virtual assistants are a front end to their respective companies backend servers. This can be a privacy concern as user data is stored and sold without their control

Glitch is an open-source offline virtual assistant designed to replace these virtual assistants with an application that is ran fully on-device.

He's pretty unfinished right now, but the alpha version of GlitchOS should be on Google Play soonish.<br />

Create new Android Studio project and import from Version Control using this link https://github.com/Minar0/GlitchOS<br />

If you'd like to get Spotify to work, you'll have to generate your own API key from Spotify's [Developer Console](https://developer.spotify.com/). You'll also need to sign your package and specify the callback URI which should be comwhminzapsos://callback
